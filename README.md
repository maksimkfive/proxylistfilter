# proxylistfilter
Ayo. If your proxy.txt looks like IP:PORT and if there is a some kind of shit after a space like:

/// 167.235.236.41:3128 DE-NOA 
165.16.119.176:1981 LY-NOA 
171.6.55.252:8080 TH-NOA-HTTPS 
72.169.65.69:87 US-HIA! 
165.16.60.192:8080 LY-NOA 
124.121.86.88:8080 TH-NOA 
186.125.218.187:999 AR-NOA 
110.164.208.125:8888 TH-NOA 
141.94.184.232:3128 FR-NOA! ///

and your thing that needs a CLEAN proxy list like just IP:PORT, then just run 'fuck.py' and it will fuck all the shit in the entire txt.

HOW DOES IT WORK???
makes no fucking sense.

WARNING: a file that contains unfiltered proxy list must be named 'proxy.txt'. It's important as fuck
If there is no 'filteredproxy.txt' - it will create it.
After - copy the list to another txt file or copy the 'filteredproxy.txt' to another location and then delete the 'filteredproxy.txt' from the folder with the program. I hope u'll deal with it. 

By the way - fuck.py must be in the same folder as your unfiltered proxy list.
